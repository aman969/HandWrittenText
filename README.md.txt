Hand Written Text Recognization.

In this project, I have tried to identify handwritten images through machine learning.
To do this I have used the following library.
1. Tensorflow
2. openCv
3. sklearn
4. numpy etc.
Currently, this project only recognizes the text of a single word image.
In future i can build more flexible, efficient, better and more accurate model for recognition handwriting.

for multiple line text we can devide image into single word image and pass to the network.
